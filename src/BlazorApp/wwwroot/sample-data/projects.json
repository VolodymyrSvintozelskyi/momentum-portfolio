    "description": "A new algorithm has been developed at LHCb to reconstruct and select very displaced vertices in real-time. The algorithm employs an optimized strategy and a Neural Network (NN) to improve track efficiency and reduce ghost rates, achieving high throughput within a limited time budget. It increases LHCb's potential for detecting long-lived particles during Run 3.",
